# Kaggle Leaf Classification

This is my result for Kaggle's leaf classification competition that ended last month. This solution initially ranked in the 14th place when I submitted it in December, but was eventually pushed to 43rd.

It follows a 2 stage pipeline, first using the images to learn representations via Deep Autoencoders, which are then concatenated to the given featues and trained jointly on a DNN.
